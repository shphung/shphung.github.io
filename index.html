                    <p>
                        Nice to meet you! I'm Steven Phung. I am a first generation college student currently enrolled as a first year computer science graduate student at Cal State Long Beach. I have always loved technology and its ability to make magic happen. I am experienced and knowledgeable with information technology and I am looking to apply myself in a job. In general, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, as well as playing games. As I often interact with games and technology, I like to muse about the creation and the process of making those products: The idea or problem the software attempting to solve, the algorithms involved, the technologies used, or the languages used. I'm always looking forward to what creative ideas people can come up with, and even coming up with some myself.

                		<b>Nature / Animals</b>. 
						<br>
						I am very interested in nature, animals, and things that are alike. If I weren't working with computers, I would definitely be working with animals.

                    <li>
                		<b>Gaming</b>.
						<br>
						I've been an enthusiastic gamer for as long as I can remember. All the different stories, art, and even certain difficulties are all shared experiences we can share with one another. My favorite game genres are story and puzzle games, and the game I have enjoyed playing for the longest time is DOTA 2.
            		</li>
					<br>
                    <li>
                		<b>Movies</b>.
						<br>
						In particular, watching a movie with someone else. Sometimes it's difficult for people to open up or make eye contact when conversing. I find a lot of people are more comfortable with opening up when we're watching movie together. Whether it's with friends or family, we can talk about anything. Sometimes you don't even have to talk about the movie, it's nice to have something to bond over. If the movie was enjoyable, everyone gets to have a good time, and if the movie wasn't? We all still have something to talk about.

I worked on trying to create a more realistic game feel by rendering grass, sand, and water blocks at the very top of the level and in small groups, rather than randomly spawning types of blocks everywhere.

                            Using the Godot game engine, I built a clone of Pong and a derivative with additional game mechanics. I added the ability to rotate the paddles, included power-ups such as speed up or slow down the ball, speed up or slow down the paddle, spawn multi-balls, and changed the scoring areas to increase the overall game tempo.
